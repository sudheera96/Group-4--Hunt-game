  * On Wednesday, We conferenced in a zoom meeting with all members of the divisions across the project. We concluded on task assigning methods with our (Design Architecture) team. 
  * Our team has assigned the roles internally like the person going to work with data team, UI Team, Backend developer, testing engineer and project manager.

### Half-Day 3

* We streamlined our choices of backend technologies to three i.e., Node.js, Java (Spring), C# (.NET). The data team has decided on using RDBMS (SQL / MySQL). UI team is also working on deciding a better platform. So, we decided to wait until other teams have fixated on technology so that we can choose a better option to integrate well with both the frontend and database.

* A Zoom meeting with our client to get answers to our queries and their suggestion on preferred technologies. A intra-division zoom meeting was held to discuss on the assigned tasks to each individual and to incorporate the changes and feedback provided by our client.
